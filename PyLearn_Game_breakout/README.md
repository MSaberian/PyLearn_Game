The Citadel, originally known as The Citadel of Ricks, was a trans-dimensional citadel city-state inhabited entirely by Ricks and Mortys from across infinite realities.

The Holographic Simulation is a giant spacecraft that appeared in the episode "M. Night Shaym-Aliens!", that made a giant holographic projection, portraying the planet Earth, created by the Zigerions to trick Rick into giving them the information for concentrated dark matter.
